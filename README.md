# IntaniaGhostRush
IntaniaGhostRush is a Java project made in Programming Methodology class.
Contributed by Notch and Fei

## Introduction

IntaniaGhostRush was inspired by two famous action games. The first one that appears when your internet is disconnected is named “Chrome Dino” on Google Chrome, and the second one that was installed on Nokia cellphones is named “Bounce” by Rovio Entertainment. The story of IntaniaGhostRush is about a CP48 student who rushed ProgMethProject too hard until he died. He wanted to submit his project to his professor, but the professor was afraid of him. Hence, the professor hired a multitude of holy monks to protect him from this student. The objective of this game is to keep your intania ghost safe from the holy monks along the journey and succeed in submitting his ProgMethProject.

## Rules

When the game has begun, the ghost starts rushing and the player can press either “W”, “A”, “D”, or the spacebar button to control their ghost leaps over incoming obstacles and the holy monks without crashing into a monk. If their ghost bumps into a monk, the game ends. Else if their ghost reaches his professor, the game also ends.
